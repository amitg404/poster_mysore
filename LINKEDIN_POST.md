## 🚀 Post Option 1: Technical Deep-Dive (Recommended for Developer Audience)

---

🎨 **Just shipped: A full-stack e-commerce platform for premium posters—from concept to production!**

After weeks of intense building, I'm excited to share my latest project: **PosterShop**—a modern e-commerce platform that combines cutting-edge web tech with print automation.

**🛠️ Tech Stack Highlights:**

**Frontend:**
• Next.js 16 with App Router + React 19 (latest with Compiler)
• TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4
• Framer Motion for buttery-smooth animations
• Zustand for lightweight state management

**Backend:**
• Express.js 5 + Prisma ORM
• PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
• Razorpay payment integration with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
• Real-time order notifications via ntfy.sh

**Print Automation (The Fun Part 🤯):**
• Python daemon monitoring Gmail for print orders
• Real-ESRGAN neural network for 4x AI upscaling
• Automatic PDF generation for print-ready output

**🔥 Key Features:**
✅ Personalized "Vibe Check" for AI-curated recommendations
✅ Server-side price validation (tamper-proof checkout)
✅ JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
✅ Affiliate system with commission tracking
✅ Cloudinary CDN for optimized image delivery
✅ Auto-sync file watcher for product management

**💡 Lessons Learned:**

1. React 19's new features are game-changing for performance
2. Combining email automation with database queries unlocks powerful workflows
3. Real-ESRGAN's ncnn-vulkan builds make GPU upscaling accessible anywhere

This project pushed me to think like a full-stack engineer, operations specialist, and print production manager—all at once.

## 🎯 Post Option 2: Storytelling + Visual Impact (For Broader Audience)

---

🖼️ **From "I want to sell posters" to a production-ready e-commerce platform in 3 weeks.**

Here's what I built:

**The Problem:**
Poster sellers struggle with:
• Manual image processing for print quality
• Tedious order management
• No personalization for customers

**The Solution: PosterShop 🛍️**

A complete platform where users can:
→ Browse 2000+ curated posters
→ Get personalized recommendations via "Vibe Check"
→ Pay securely (Razorpay)
→ Get instant order notifications
→ Receive print-ready PDFs automatically

**The Interesting Part?**

When an order comes in:

1. Email lands in inbox
2. Python daemon detects it
3. Fetches image URL from PostgreSQL
4. Upscales it 4x using AI (Real-ESRGAN)
5. Converts to print-ready PDF
6. Ready for the printer!

All. Automated. 🤖

**Tech I Used:**
• Next.js 16 + React 19 (cutting-edge!)
• Express.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL
• Cloudinary for CDN
• Razorpay for payments
• Python + Real-ESRGAN for AI upscaling

**What I Learned:**
• Building for real users vs. building for tutorials is VERY different
• The last 10% of polish takes 50% of the time
• Full-stack means owning the entire pipeline
